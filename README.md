# Feature-Rich Calendar Application

## About The Project

This project is a calendar application designed with functionality and
simplicity in mind. It allows users to create, edit, and organize tasks directly
within the calendar without the need for external libraries. The application
supports drag-and-drop for easy task management and provides a visual
representation of worldwide holidays.
